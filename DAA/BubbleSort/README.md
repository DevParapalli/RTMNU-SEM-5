# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Bubble Sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes Bubble Sort inefficient for large lists and real-world applications.The best case time complexity is O(n), which occurs when the array is already sorted.
