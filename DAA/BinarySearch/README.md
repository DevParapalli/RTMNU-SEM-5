# BinarySearch

Binary search is a search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or determined to be not present in the array. This algorithm is based on the principle of divide and conquer and is highly efficient for large sorted arrays.

The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the size of the array. This is because each comparison reduces the search interval by half, resulting in a highly efficient search algorithm. However, binary search requires that the array is sorted before searching, which can add an extra O(n log n) complexity if the array is unsorted.

Binary search is typically used for large sorted arrays, where it is highly efficient and can provide significant performance gains over linear search
