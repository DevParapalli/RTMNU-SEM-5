# LinearSearch

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of an array to see if it matches a given target value. The algorithm works by starting at the beginning of the array and comparing each element with the target value until a match is found or the end of the array is reached. If the target value is found, the algorithm returns the index of the element in the array. If the target value is not found, the algorithm returns a special value indicating that the target value is not present in the array.

The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because in the worst case, the algorithm must compare the target value with every element in the array before determining that the target value is not present. However, in the best case, the target value is found at the first index, resulting in a time complexity of O(1).

Linear search is typically used for small arrays or for unsorted arrays where other algorithms like binary search cannot be used. It can also be used for searching linked lists, where it is more efficient than binary search.
