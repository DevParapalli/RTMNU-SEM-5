# P6_SquaresCubesTable

The `<template>` tag is used as a container to hold some HTML content hidden from the user when the page loads.

The content inside `<template>` can be rendered later with a JavaScript.

You can use the `<template>` tag if you have some HTML code you want to use over and over again, but not until you ask for it. To do this without the `<template>` tag, you have to create the HTML code with JavaScript to prevent the browser from rendering the code.

Table rendering in JavaScript involves dynamically creating and manipulating HTML tables using JavaScript code. This technique is often used to display tabular data in a more dynamic and interactive manner on a webpage. Instead of hardcoding the table structure and content in HTML, you can use JavaScript to generate the table elements and populate them with data. Here's how table rendering in JavaScript works:

1. **Creating the Table Element:** To begin, you'll need an existing HTML element (like a `<div>`) where you want to place your dynamically generated table. This element will serve as a container for your table.

2. **Generating Table Structure:** Use JavaScript to create the main `<table>` element along with its child elements, such as `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tr>`. These elements define the structure of the table, including the header row and the body rows.

3. **Populating Data:** Fetch the data you want to display in the table. This data could come from an API, a database, or any other source. Loop through the data and dynamically create `<tr>` (table row) elements for each data item. Within each row, create `<td>` (table cell) elements for each column of data.

4. **Appending to DOM:** As you generate the table structure and populate it with data, append these elements to the main container element in the DOM. This will make the table visible on the webpage.

5. **Event Handling:** If you want to make your table interactive, you can attach event handlers to specific cells or rows. For example, you could highlight a row when a user clicks on it or display additional information when a user hovers over a cell.

6. **Styling and Formatting:** Apply CSS styles to the generated table elements to control the appearance of the table, such as fonts, colors, borders, and spacing.
