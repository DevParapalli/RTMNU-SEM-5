# P8_SearchBarJS

In JavaScript, when working with web pages, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a crucial concept. It represents the structured content of a webpage, and you can use JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the DOM to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Concepts used in this practical:

1. **DOMContentLoaded:**
   The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed by the browser, and all the DOM elements are accessible. This event is essential for executing JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM because it ensures that the entire DOM is ready for manipulation. It's typically used to initiate actions or set up event listeners once the page content is available.

2. **Click Event Listener:**
   A click event listener is a way to respond to user interactions with a webpage. When a user clicks on a particular element (e.g., a button, a link, an image), a "click" event is generated. You can attach an event listener to that element using JavaScript to listen for this event. When the event occurs, the associated JavaScript code is executed, allowing you to perform actions like showing/hiding content, updating data, or triggering animations.

3. **Attribute Manipulation:**
   In HTML, elements can have attributes (e.g., `class`, `id`, `data-`, etc.) that provide additional information about the element. Attribute manipulation refers to the process of changing or updating these attributes using JavaScript. You can access and modify attributes using properties of DOM elements. For example, you can change the `src` attribute of an image element to load a different image or update the `class` attribute to apply different styles.

4. **DOM Manipulation:**
   DOM manipulation involves changing the structure, content, or appearance of a webpage using JavaScript. This can include actions like adding new elements, removing existing elements, modifying text content, and altering the styling of elements. By interacting with the DOM, you can create dynamic user interfaces, update content without requiring a page reload, and provide a seamless user experience.
